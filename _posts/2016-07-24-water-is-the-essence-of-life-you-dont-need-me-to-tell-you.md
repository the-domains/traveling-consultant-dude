  Water is the essence of life. You don’t need me to tell you that. When
  traveling, good clean water that you want to drink is as scarce as a
  republican in Santa Monica (water, is actually pretty scarce there too). After
  a long day in the field, all you really want is a nice glass of chilled water
  with those condensation beads on the side, you know, so you’re drinking water
  from inside the glass, and your chapped bottom lip also gets some hydration
  action too.

Yes, four dollars for a bottle of water. Yeah, I know, i'm not entitled to free glacier water. This is how the world works. This is in my Marriot Courtyard hotel room in downtown Pasadena. I'm looking at it right now, in fact, letting out a little chuckle. I need to get a pay raise: I solved this problem.

Now I'm sure many of you will think, "just drink it from the sink, dude!" Well, I will not stoop that low. I will not drink sub-par, room temperature tap water out of the fine china the Marriot has provided me.

"Then, Traveling Consultant Dude, what is you solution to this near-life-threatening crisis that so many traveling consultant dudes/dudettes face?" You see, every hotel has a gym, and in every gym is this:
